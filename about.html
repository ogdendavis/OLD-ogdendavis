      <p>I’m a developer who uses my background in business and communication to help individuals and organizations identify their critical goals, translate those goals into specific communication and interaction objectives for their online presence, and build the digital tools to enable and support those mutually productive interactions.</p>
      <p>What does that actually mean? It means that I can help you figure out what you need to achieve with your online presence and how to make it happen.</p>
      <p>I’m a business owner and an MBA graduate, so I understand the world of revenue, marketing, and P&L sheets. I can help you grow your business with an online presence that specifically cultivates interactions and outcomes that support your organization’s big-picture mission as well as your short-term goals.</p>
      <p>I’m a writer and content creator, so I understand how to craft a message that resonates with your target audience. I can help you build your brand with an online presence that speaks directly to the people you’re trying to reach in language they understand and in a way that appeals to them.</p>
      <p>I’m a developer, so I understand how to implement a web application that is modern, functional across all devices, and easily usable for both you and your audience. I can create web platforms that use the latest technology to ensure that you can effectively reach your audience 24/7/365, and that convert virtual interactions into real-world benefit for you and your users.</p>
      <p>I’m also a flannel-wearing, beard-sporting guy who loves being outside, riding his bike, and hanging out on the couch with my wife, our cat, and a good book. I’ve lived in 5 states and 2 countries, I own a fitness business, and I once won a “Macarena” contest at my local skating rink.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to chat about a project for yourself or your organization, your great web app idea, or the literary genius of Terry Pratchett, shoot me an email at lucas@ogdendavis.com.</p>
