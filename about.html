      <p>My career has been all about communication. I've written press releases as a public relations coordinator, designed user experiences and information architecture as a content manager, connected with auditoriums full of students and parents as an admission counselor and teacher, and coached athletes through complex movements one-on-one as a CrossFit coach.
      </p>
      <p>Today, we constantly communicate with each other, learn together, and build relationships online. I got into web development because the internet is full of opportunities to make meaningful connections with and develop unique experiences for a wide variety of audiences, and I want to be a part of making that happen in a way that's effective, engaging, and fun for everyone involved.

        <figcaption class="figure__caption">Freyja doesn't really like bikes, but she likes how our shoes smell when we get home.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When I'm not coding, writing, or brainstorming, I'm hanging out with my wife, Kim, and our dachshund-poodle mix, Freyja. The three of us love hanging out on the couch with good books or a silly reality television show, walking around our quiet neighborhood in small-town Georgia, and riding our bicycles.
